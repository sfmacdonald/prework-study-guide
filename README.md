 # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. 

- My motivation for this project was to build a foundation of knowledge in order to be successful in the ASU Coding Bootcamp by discussing the following items:
    -HTML
    -CSS
    -JavaScript
    -GitHub
    -MacOS Terminal
    -Chrome Inspect
    -VS Code
- Without completing the pre-work project, I would not have the understanding of how the different components of coding as well as workflows work together.
- It helped me determine what I did and did not know in the coding world while also taking what I did know and recognizing how key words like "HTML" and "GitHub" meant and worked.
- I learned how to leverage git replications and utilizing the terminal to connect GitHub as well as VS Code to complete and review work prior to pushing to my repository.
